The data suggests that there are several users who have access levels that do not match their assigned roles in the system. Specifically, there are users who have access levels of "maker", "checker", or "read-only" but should have a different level according to their role. 

There are also users who have unauthorized access to certain systems ("system_a_access", "system_b_access", and "system_c_access").

This could indicate issues with the user management system, such as incorrect assignments of roles or permissions.

To resolve this issue, it would be necessary to review the user roles and permissions and make any necessary corrections. This may involve re-assigning users to their correct roles or updating the permissions for certain systems.

Additionally, implementing a more robust user management system with better access control mechanisms could help prevent such issues in the future.
