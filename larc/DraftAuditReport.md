# Comprehensive Audit Report

## Executive Summary
This audit report consolidates findings from access reviews, transaction limit compliance analyses, change management audits, and transaction policy compliance reviews. The findings are categorized by risk level (Critical, High, Medium, Low) to prioritize remediation efforts. Key issues identified include unauthorized access, transaction approvals exceeding user limits, and non-compliance with change management policies.

## Detailed Findings

### Critical Findings
1. **Unauthorized Access**:
   - **USER021**: Unauthorized access to system_a_access, system_b_access, and system_c_access.
   - **USER022**: Unauthorized access to system_a_access, system_b_access, and system_c_access.
   - **USER023**: Unauthorized access to system_a_access, system_b_access, and system_c_access.
   - **USER024**: Unauthorized access to system_a_access, system_b_access, and system_c_access.

2. **Transaction Limit Exceedances**:
   - **Transaction 0**: Approved by USER008, exceeding their approval limit.
   - **Transaction 3**: Approved by USER009, exceeding their approval limit.
   - **Transaction 7**: Approved by USER010, exceeding their approval limit.
   - **Transaction 9**: Approved by USER005, exceeding their approval limit.
   - **Transaction 14**: Approved by USER001, USER002, and USER003, exceeding their joint approval limit.

### High Findings
1. **Access Level Mismatches**:
   - **USER001**: system_b_access level mismatch (maker vs. checker).
   - **USER002**: system_b_access level mismatch (maker vs. read-only).
   - **USER003**: system_a_access level mismatch (maker vs. read-only).
   - **USER005**: system_b_access level mismatch (maker vs. checker).
   - **USER006**: system_c_access level mismatch (maker vs. read-only).
   - **USER008**: system_c_access level mismatch (read-only vs. checker).
   - **USER009**: system_a_access level mismatch (checker vs. read-only).
   - **USER010**: system_c_access level mismatch (maker vs. checker).
   - **USER012**: system_b_access level mismatch (maker vs. checker).
   - **USER014**: system_b_access level mismatch (checker vs. read-only).
   - **USER016**: system_b_access level mismatch (maker vs. checker).
   - **USER017**: system_a_access level mismatch (maker vs. checker).

2. **Change Management Non-Compliance**:
   - Multiple transactions were approved without proper change management verification, leading to potential risks in audit trail integrity.

### Medium Findings
1. **Transaction Policy Violations**:
   - Several transactions were flagged for non-compliance with transaction policies, including approvals by unauthorized users or exceeding single/joint approval limits.

### Low Findings
1. **Access Level Matches**:
   - **USER004**, **USER007**, **USER013**, **USER018**: All access levels match the access matrix.
   - **USER011**, **USER015**, **USER019**, **USER020**: No discrepancies found in access levels.

## Root Cause Analysis
- **Unauthorized Access**: Lack of regular access reviews and updates to the access matrix.
- **Access Level Mismatches**: Inconsistent application of access control policies during user provisioning.
- **Transaction Limit Exceedances**: Insufficient training on approval limits and lack of automated checks during transaction approvals.
- **Change Management Non-Compliance**: Inadequate enforcement of change management SLAs and audit trail verification processes.

## Recommendations
1. **Access Management**:
   - Conduct regular access reviews and update the access matrix to reflect current user roles.
   - Implement automated access control systems to prevent mismatches.

2. **Transaction Approvals**:
   - Provide training on approval limits and implement automated checks to prevent exceedances.
   - Enforce joint approval requirements for high-value transactions.

3. **Change Management**:
   - Strengthen enforcement of change management SLAs.
   - Conduct regular audits of change management processes to ensure compliance.

4. **Policy Compliance**:
   - Regularly review and update transaction policies.
   - Implement automated policy compliance checks for all transactions.

This report highlights critical areas requiring immediate attention and provides actionable recommendations to mitigate risks and improve compliance.
