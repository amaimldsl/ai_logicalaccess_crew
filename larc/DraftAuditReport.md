# Comprehensive Audit Report

## 1. Logical Access Findings

### Critical Findings
- **Unauthorized Access**: 4 users (USER021, USER022, USER023, USER024) have access to systems they are not authorized to use. This poses a significant security risk as unauthorized access can lead to data breaches or misuse of sensitive systems.
  - **Root Cause**: Lack of proper access control enforcement and periodic access reviews.
  - **Recommendation**: Immediate revocation of unauthorized access and implementation of stricter access control policies.

### High Findings
- **Access Discrepancies**: 12 users (USER001, USER002, USER003, USER005, USER006, USER008, USER009, USER010, USER012, USER014, USER016, USER017) have access levels that do not match the authorized access matrix.
  - **Root Cause**: Inconsistent application of access levels during user provisioning or role changes.
  - **Recommendation**: Align user access levels with the authorized access matrix and conduct regular access reviews.

## 2. Transaction Limit Compliance Findings

### High Findings
- **Limit Violations**: 4 transactions (Transaction 0, Transaction 3, Transaction 7, Transaction 9, Transaction 14) exceed the authorized approval limits.
  - **Root Cause**: Lack of proper validation during transaction approval processes.
  - **Recommendation**: Implement stricter validation checks and ensure all transactions comply with established approval hierarchies.

### Low Findings
- **Compliant Transactions**: 11 transactions are within the authorized approval limits.
  - **Root Cause**: Proper adherence to transaction approval policies.
  - **Recommendation**: Continue monitoring and enforcing compliance with transaction approval limits.

## 3. Audit Trail Compliance Findings

### Critical Findings
- **Non-Compliant Transactions**: 14 transactions were found to have deviations from change management policies, including missing change tickets and unauthorized user actions.
  - **Root Cause**: Lack of enforcement of change management policies and inadequate oversight.
  - **Recommendation**: Investigate and remediate all non-compliant transactions immediately. Ensure all future changes are accompanied by valid change tickets and are carried out by authorized users.

### Low Findings
- **Compliant Transactions**: 6 transactions were verified and found to be compliant with change management policies.
  - **Root Cause**: Proper adherence to change management policies.
  - **Recommendation**: Continue enforcing change management policies and conduct regular audits to maintain compliance.

## 4. Policy Compliance Findings

### Critical Findings
- **Unauthorized Changes**: 3 transactions (DataProcessor, SecurityModule, ConfigSettings) were modified by unauthorized users (USER009, USER002, USER005).
  - **Root Cause**: Lack of proper user authorization checks during change processes.
  - **Recommendation**: Implement stricter user authorization checks and ensure only authorized users can make changes.

### High Findings
- **Missing Change Tickets**: 11 transactions were modified without valid change tickets.
  - **Root Cause**: Lack of enforcement of change ticket requirements.
  - **Recommendation**: Ensure all future changes are accompanied by valid change tickets and conduct regular audits to enforce compliance.
